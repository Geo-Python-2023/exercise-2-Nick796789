You will also get to practice the Markdown syntax. \n\n## Notes about the exercise notebook\n\n- The Python code cells where you should make changes contain text that reads\n\n    ```Python\n\n    # YOUR CODE HERE\n    raise NotImplementedError()\n    \n    ```\n    <br/>**You should delete that text and replace it with your solution (code)** to answer each coding question.\n    \n- The Markdown cells where you should make changes contain text that reads\n\n    ```text\n    \n    YOUR ANSWER HERE\n    ```\n    <br/>**You should delete that text and replace it with your answer** to answer each of this type of question.\n- Some of the cells in this Jupyter Notebook are \"Read-only\", which means that you are not able to edit them.\n- Some of the code cells contain tests. If these tests fail (i.e., you see an error message), you know there is still something wrong with your code that you should fix.\n\n### Tips for completing this exercise\n\n- Use **exactly** the same variable names as in the instructions because your answers will be automatically graded, and the tests that grade your answers rely on following the same formatting or variable naming as in the instructions.\n- **Please do not**:\n\n    - **Change the file names**. Do all of your editing in the provided `Exercise-2.ipynb` file (this file).\n    - **Copy/paste cells in this notebook**. We use an automated grading system that will fail if there are copies of code cells.\n    - **Change the existing cell types**. You can add cells, but changing the cell types for existing cells (from code to markdown, for example) will also cause the automated grader to fail.","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"45f0e4f0945ae3265f5b25da23748071","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-577a4204893ab1a5","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## AI tool usage agreement\n\n**Enter your name (and that of your partner) in the cell below** to confirm that you have followed the [course guidelines on the use of AI tools](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/ai-tools.html) and understand that misuse of AI tools is considered cheating.","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"5aed46883eb7c63525992bcc28650a0a","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-1ed1c4a09d14d2e3","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"YOUR ANSWER HERE","metadata":{"deletable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"4bf1792def96077b38161f120b7fe3e2","grade":true,"grade_id":"AI-LLM_statement","locked":false,"points":0,"schema_version":3,"solution":true,"task":false},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 0 -
